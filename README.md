***installation instructions****; 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________VMmanager installation guide
Hierarchy:	VMmanager KVM -> VMmanager KVM setup and configuration
VMmanager Cloud -> VMmanager Cloud setup and configuration
Recommendations
Before you start the installation, please read the following articles:

VMmanager_principles:https://doc.ispsystem.com/index.php/VMmanager_principles
Cluster node configuration:https://doc.ispsystem.com/index.php/Cluster_node_configuration


License policy
If you do not have an active license during installation, a free version will get activated and installed automatically. This free version comes with the following resource limitation: in VMmanager you can create only 2 virtual machines with total amount of RAM = 16 Gb.
If you have a "commercial license", it will be activated automatically, given that your server's public IP address matches the license IP.
If you purchased a commercial version and the license IP address doesn't match the server IP (your server has private IP address), execute the command:
export ACTIVATION_KEY=<activation_key>
Installation
VMmanager is installed and updated from the OS repository.

SELinux will be disabled during the installation to ensure the correct operation of the control panel.

1. Connect to the server via SSH with the superuser permissions.

2. Install wget if needed:

yum install wget
3. Download the installation script:

wget http://cdn.ispsystem.com/install.sh
4. Run the script:

sh install.sh VMmanager
To install a certain version of the control panel, run install.sh with the --release parameter. E.g.:

sh install.sh VMmanager --release 5.50
If you have a lifetime license, please pay attention to its updates expiration date. If updates for your lifetime license have already expired during setup, trying to install the latest version of the corresponding control panel will cause issues with license activation. In this case, you need to start the installation process with the --release 5.50 parameter, where 5.50 is the latest version available for a lifetime license
The script will offer to select a version you want to install: beta or release, and connect the corresponding ISPsystem repository. It will also connect other required repositories (EPEL for CentOS) and update the package cache.

Select VMmanager and its version from the list of software products. The installation script will install the control panel and required software from the system repository.


VMmanager installation
Once completed, you can access VMmanager at:

Url: https://<server ip address>:1500/vmmgr

Login: root

Password: <root password>

Once you are done with the installation, update QEMU and libvirt:

yum install centos-release-qemu-ev
yum update

Can't get the key? These kids revoked the SSL? API giving you a hard time? Fixed: https://github.com/free2er/certbot-regru
